## **CR(I) deep-well pumps, 50 Hz**

CR(I) deep-well pumps are used for deep-well pumping
in small water supply systems where water is pumped
from depths (H D ) down to 90 metres.


# GRUNDFOS DATA SHEET

From the chamber, it is pressed into the diffusor (D) by
the water jet from the nozzle (C). There the two water
flows mix, and the velocity is converted into pressure,
driving the water up through the riser pipe (H) to the
suction port of the pump.




## **Technical data**

Max. system pressure: 16 bar

Max. ambient temperature: +40°C

Max. liquid temperature: +40°C

Minimum size of borehole: 3"

## **Selection of ejector pump**



**Fig. 1** System with CR(I) pump


The pump system consists of a dry-installed CR(I)
multistage centrifugal pump connected to a submerged
ejector via two pipes.


It is advisable to connect a pressure tank to the discharge side of the pump to maintain a suitable pressure
at the tapping point.







**Fig. 2** Sectional drawing of ejector


Water is pumped through the pressure pipe (A) and the
strainer (B) to the nozzle (C). The water passes the
nozzle at high speed and runs into the diffusor (D). Via
the strainer (E) and bottom valve (F), water which is to
be pumped up is in connection with the chamber (G).



The ejector pump is selected on the basis of the curve

chart overleaf.


**Curve conditions**

The flow rate (Q) is based on the following conditions:


- The pump is installed at the well/borehole.


- The ejector is at the depths stated in relation to the

pump.


- The water level is above the ejector.


**Note:** If the pump is placed 10 to 30 metres from the
borehole, reduction can be prevented by using pipes
one dimension larger than the dimensions in the table

overleaf.


**Example of selection of ejector pump**
The ejector pump is selected on the basis of


- required suction depth, H D, in metres.

- required flow rate, Q, in m [3] /h.


When the duty point is known, the pump, ejector and
pipe dimension can be selected from the curve chart.


**Example:**


Required suction depth, H D : 50 [m]
Required flow rate, Q: 0.8 [m [3] /h]


The pump which meets these requirements the best is
CR(I) 5-13 with ejector no. 20B.


**Use of suction pipe**

If the well capacity is lower than the pump capacity, dry
running of the pump can be prevented by fitting a
suction pipe below the ejector. To enable this, the
ejector strainer (E) is replaced with a special threaded
nipple.
